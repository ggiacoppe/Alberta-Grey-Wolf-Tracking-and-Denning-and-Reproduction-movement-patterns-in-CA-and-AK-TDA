# Alberta-Grey-Wolf-Tracking-and-Denning-and-Reproduction-movement-patterns-in-CA-and-AK-TDA is a capstone MAT 585 Topological Data Analysis 

Part 1: GPS tracking time-vary clustering (how does wolf pack cluster structure vary from time to time?)
When cleaning and preparing these datasets I answered:
1. How many time steps do you have? (Hours,Min,Seconds)
2. Are the wolves the same in each time step? No, they are not. Some packs are not seen at a certain day.
3.  What is the time resolution? I am using 31-day interval.
4.  How does the cluster structure change with time? 

Part 2: Weather factors that influence wolf den and wolf reproductive movement
When cleaning and preparing the data I answered:
1. How many years do you have in the study? 17 years
2. What do various weather conditions look like in this time series?
